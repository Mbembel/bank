       <p>
        LA MAF BANK was formed in 2008 at the initiative of the World Bank, the Government of Cameroon and representatives of Cameroon industry. The principal objective was to create a development financial institution for providing medium-term and long-term project financing to rural communities with a view to developing the rural economy by providing, for the purpose of development of agriculture, trade, commerce, industry and other productive activities in the rural areas, credit and other facilities, particularly to small and marginal farmers, agricultural labourers, artisans and small entrepreneurs, and for matters connected therewith and incidental thereto.. LA MAF transformed its business from a development financial institution offering only project finance to a diversified financial services provider that, along with its subsidiaries and other group companies, offered a wide variety of products and services. As Cameroon’s economy became more market-oriented and integrated with the world economy, LA MAF capitalized on the new opportunities to provide a wider range of financial products and services to rural communites clients. 
 <br>

        The case of LA MAF BANK  is somehow different. The last thirteen (13) years was a period of steady growth with the scale in the immediate past beginning 2015 unprecedented in its history. By grace of God and crisis management solutions, this growth trend was unabated with LMB crossing the P1.8 billion mark by end of 2020 for the first time ever. The Bank remarkably pulled off a 5% growth rate during the same period when the national economy posted a negative 4% performance. While no banking institution including LMB was exempt from the disaster that transpired in the year 2020, the way the Bank managed to thrive in these difficult times is deemed as equally momentous if not more significant compared to what it previously achieved considering the magnitude of the economic impact this public health crisis had caused.
         <br>
        
        LMF’s unfailing commitment to its legal mandate of extending loans “primarily for the purpose of meeting the credit needs of farmers” under Republic Act 7353 is beyond doubt.

        The bank has proven its ability to sustain the delivery of credit services to this sector despite the greater risks inherent in agriculture industry. While to most banks these risks associated with agriculture are limiting factors, to LMB reaching-out to un-served farming communities is inspiring. It is an accomplishment of its advocacy to bring financial services to the people who need it most – the marginalized and un-served segments of the society. The growing number of LMB loan beneficiaries from the ranks of small farmers in 2018 measures up the greater impact the Bank contributes in the delivery of inclusive financial services.

          <h3>LA MAF BANK</h3>
          <p>I joined LA MAF BANK in May 2021. Since then, I have been a Credit Officer and currently I am in Global Markets as a Dealer. Working in the biggest rural bank in Cameroon is a dream come true. One gets hands on experience in global markets, currency, equity and bonds. As prices are volatile and subject to changes every moment, one has to be extremely careful and on their toes every second. What I really like about working in Bank is the comprehensive training that you get on joining.</p>
